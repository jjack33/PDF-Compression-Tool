## üìä Example Results

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Option 1: Quick Download
1. **Download ZIP** - Click green "Code" button ‚Üí "Download ZIP"
2. **Extract** - Unzip all files to a folder (like Desktop)
3. **Get Ghostscript** - Download `gs10051w64.exe` from [Ghostscript Downloads](https://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html)
4. **Place together** - Put `gs10051w64.exe` in the same folder as the other files
5. **Run** - Double-click `run_compressor.bat`

### Option 2: Git Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jjack33/PDF-Compression-Tool.git
cd PDF-Compression-Tool
# Download gs10051w64.exe and place it in this folder
# Double-click run_compressor.bat
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Ghostscript installer not found" error?
- **Check folder** - Make sure `gs10051w64.exe` is in the same folder as `run_compressor.bat`
- **Re-download** - Get the installer again from [Ghostscript Downloads](https://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html)
- **Correct name** - Ensure the file is named exactly `gs10051w64.exe`

### File picker doesn't appear?
- Check your taskbar for a flashing icon
- Try the debug version: `run_compressor_debug.bat`
- Look for the dialog on other monitors if you have multiple displays

### "Execution policy" error?
- The batch file handles this automatically
- Make sure you're running `run_compressor.bat`, not the `.ps1` file directly
- Run as administrator if problems persist

### Ghostscript installation issues?
- Close everything and try again
- Make sure you're not running from inside a zip file
- Manually download and install Ghostscript first, then run the tool
- Check if antivirus is blocking the installer

### Compression fails?
- Ensure PDF files aren't corrupted
- Check if files are password-protected (not supported)
- Try with a different PDF to isolate the issue
- Run debug mode to see detailed error messages

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

### Compression Settings
- **Device:** `pdfwrite` (PDF output device)
- **Compatibility:** PDF 1.4 (maximum compatibility)
- **Quality:** `/screen` (optimized for viewing, good compression)
- **Processing:** Lossless optimization + recompression
- **Safety:** Original files never modified

### Security
- **Admin rights:** Only required for Ghostscript installation
- **Network:** No internet connections after initial Ghostscript download
- **Privacy:** All processing happens locally on your machine
- **Code:** Open source - inspect the PowerShell script yourself

### File Detection Logic
The script automatically finds Ghostscript in these locations:
1. Same folder as the script
2. System PATH environment variable
3. `C:\Program Files\gs\*\bin\`
4. `C:\Program Files (x86)\gs\*\bin\`
