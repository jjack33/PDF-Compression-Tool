2. **Extract** all files to a folder (Desktop works great)
3. **Download Ghostscript installer** - Get `gs10051w64.exe` from [Ghostscript.com](https://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html) and **put it in the same folder** as the extracted files
4. **Double-click** `run_compressor.bat`
5. **Select** your PDF files when prompted
6. **Done!** Compressed files automatically appear with "_COMPRESSED" in the name

- **~50MB disk space** (for Ghostscript installation)

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Auto-elevation** - Requests admin rights if needed for Ghostscript installation
2. **Ghostscript detection** - Finds existing installation or installs it automatically
3. **File selection** - Clean Windows file picker for choosing PDFs
4. **Compression** - Uses Ghostscript with optimal settings for size reduction
5. **Output** - Saves compressed files in same folders as originals

## 📊 Example Results

**Before:**
```
📁 Documents/
├── Tax_Return_2024.pdf     (2.5 MB)
└── Invoice_Jan.pdf         (1.8 MB)
```

**After:**
```
📁 Documents/
├── Tax_Return_2024.pdf              (2.5 MB) ← original unchanged
├── Tax_Return_2024_COMPRESSED.pdf   (800 KB) ← new compressed version
├── Invoice_Jan.pdf                  (1.8 MB) ← original unchanged
└── Invoice_Jan_COMPRESSED.pdf       (600 KB) ← new compressed version
```

**Typical compression:** 60-80% size reduction with minimal quality loss

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Option 1: Quick Download
1. **Download ZIP** - Click green "Code" button → "Download ZIP"
2. **Extract** - Unzip all files to a folder (like Desktop)
3. **Get Ghostscript** - Download `gs10051w64.exe` from [Ghostscript Downloads](https://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html)
4. **Place together** - Put `gs10051w64.exe` in the same folder as the other files
5. **Run** - Double-click `run_compressor.bat`

### Option 2: Git Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jjack33/PDF-Compression-Tool.git
cd PDF-Compression-Tool
# Download gs10051w64.exe and place it in this folder
# Double-click run_compressor.bat
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Ghostscript installer not found" error?
- **Check folder** - Make sure `gs10051w64.exe` is in the same folder as `run_compressor.bat`
- **Re-download** - Get the installer again from [Ghostscript Downloads](https://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html)
- **Correct name** - Ensure the file is named exactly `gs10051w64.exe`

### File picker doesn't appear?
- Check your taskbar for a flashing icon
- Try the debug version: `run_compressor_debug.bat`
- Look for the dialog on other monitors if you have multiple displays

### "Execution policy" error?
- The batch file handles this automatically
- Make sure you're running `run_compressor.bat`, not the `.ps1` file directly
- Run as administrator if problems persist

### Ghostscript installation issues?
- Close everything and try again
- Make sure you're not running from inside a zip file
- Manually download and install Ghostscript first, then run the tool
- Check if antivirus is blocking the installer

### Compression fails?
- Ensure PDF files aren't corrupted
- Check if files are password-protected (not supported)
- Try with a different PDF to isolate the issue
- Run debug mode to see detailed error messages

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Compression Settings
- **Device:** `pdfwrite` (PDF output device)
- **Compatibility:** PDF 1.4 (maximum compatibility)
- **Quality:** `/screen` (optimized for viewing, good compression)
- **Processing:** Lossless optimization + recompression
- **Safety:** Original files never modified

### Security
- **Admin rights:** Only required for Ghostscript installation
- **Network:** No internet connections after initial Ghostscript download
- **Privacy:** All processing happens locally on your machine
- **Code:** Open source - inspect the PowerShell script yourself

### File Detection Logic
The script automatically finds Ghostscript in these locations:
1. Same folder as the script
2. System PATH environment variable
3. `C:\Program Files\gs\*\bin\`
4. `C:\Program Files (x86)\gs\*\bin\`
